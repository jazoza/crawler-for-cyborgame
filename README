A simple Python analysis tool for play scripts. It takes a text file as input, and writes a text file as output. 

It prompts user for input and searches for the string in the whole text. It can display all lines that a person is saying or all scene introductions. 

It should create a dictionary of scene introductions which can be browsed through choronologically.

Created in SINLAB for the Cyborgame project in collaboration with Gildas Milin, April-July 2013
